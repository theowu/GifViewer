# GifViewer
A macOS GifViewer, since I didn't find any software that package many gif files into a single pdf-style file, i wrote it myself.

The inital version does not support "add your own file" functionnality, you have to replace or add your own gif files in the application bundle and modify the related code yourself.

Enjoy it!
